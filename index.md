# ManoaQuest

## No More Boring Classes

No matter if you’re a professor or a student coursework can feel like a drag. Students struggle with motivation while professors try to keep the material engaging. ManoaQuest is one possible solution.

ManoaQuest gamifies courses at UH Manoa. When a professor integrates ManoaQuest into a course it doesn’t require any changes in scheduling. Rather ManoaQuest turns homework assignments into quest with rewards upon completion. Students can track their progress and compete with other students on the leaderboard.

These small features motivates students through rewards and competition. It keeps students engaged at the cost of a small time investment from the professor. The end goal of ManoaQuest is to boost the overall grades of students in a positive and engaging way.

## ManoaQuest Features

  * The professor can create quest whether it’s studying with a partner or turning in assignments.   

* Personal avatar:

* Leaderboard:
  * Students can feel competitive. Getting a high score on a quiz can push your avatar up the rankings.

* Notifications:
  * ManoaQuest will send an email with reminders about quest before they expire.

## Development History
## Milestone 1 - Mockup and Deployment: 
Our first project milestone set goals to create HTML mockup pages for our webapp in Meteor. Additionally since we created the webapp in Meteor, we also set out to link all the pages together using FlowRouter. The last goal is to deploy our app to Galaxy so that we can have a live version to test with.

[GitHub Project - Milestone 1](https://github.com/manoaquest/ManoaQuest/projects/1)

Our goals in this milestone was managed by GitHub's project manager feature with each goal implemented as a card that we could move between a backlog, in progress, and finished.

Each group member worked in their own branch and then merged into the master branch when we all completed our work.

## Milestone 2 - Mockup and Deployment: 
For this milestone, we decided to jump ahead and connect the database to every page that needed a database. We also were able to route the pages through the students id's.

- Ensure all pages are connected
- Ensure database setup is perfect
- Correct routing based on user login
- 404, Unauthorized page creation
- Uniform styling!
- Custom sprites!
